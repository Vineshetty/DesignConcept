The **Builder Pattern** is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. It allows you to produce different representations of an object using the same construction process. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to build an object with many optional parts or configurations.

### Example Scenario: E-commerce Order Builder

In an e-commerce platform, we might need to create complex `Order` objects that have many optional parts, such as discounts, gift wrap, shipping options, and different payment methods. The Builder Pattern can help structure the order creation process while keeping the code flexible and readable.

### Code Example

#### Step 1: Create the `Order` Class with Multiple Optional Attributes

The `Order` class represents a complex object with many optional parts.

```csharp
public class Order
{
    public string ProductName { get; set; }
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
    public bool HasGiftWrap { get; set; }
    public string ShippingMethod { get; set; }
    public string PaymentMethod { get; set; }
    public decimal Discount { get; set; }

    public override string ToString()
    {
        return $"Order: {ProductName} x{Quantity}, GiftWrap: {HasGiftWrap}, " +
               $"Shipping: {ShippingMethod}, Payment: {PaymentMethod}, Discount: {Discount}%";
    }
}
```

#### Step 2: Define the `OrderBuilder` Class

The builder class helps create an `Order` object by setting its properties step by step.

```csharp
public class OrderBuilder
{
    private readonly Order _order = new Order();

    public OrderBuilder SetProduct(string productName, int quantity)
    {
        _order.ProductName = productName;
        _order.Quantity = quantity;
        return this;
    }

    public OrderBuilder AddGiftWrap()
    {
        _order.HasGiftWrap = true;
        return this;
    }

    public OrderBuilder SetShippingMethod(string method)
    {
        _order.ShippingMethod = method;
        return this;
    }

    public OrderBuilder SetPaymentMethod(string method)
    {
        _order.PaymentMethod = method;
        return this;
    }

    public OrderBuilder ApplyDiscount(decimal discount)
    {
        _order.Discount = discount;
        return this;
    }

    public Order Build()
    {
        return _order;
    }
}
```

In this `OrderBuilder`, each method modifies the `Order` object and returns the builder itself, allowing for a fluent interface where methods can be chained together.

#### Step 3: Use the `OrderBuilder` to Construct an Order

In the client code, we use the builder to construct an `Order` with only the desired attributes, making it flexible and clear.

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Build an order with specific configurations
        var orderBuilder = new OrderBuilder();
        Order myOrder = orderBuilder
            .SetProduct("Laptop", 1)
            .AddGiftWrap()
            .SetShippingMethod("Express")
            .SetPaymentMethod("Credit Card")
            .ApplyDiscount(10)
            .Build();

        Console.WriteLine(myOrder);

        // Build another order with different configurations
        Order anotherOrder = orderBuilder
            .SetProduct("Headphones", 2)
            .SetShippingMethod("Standard")
            .SetPaymentMethod("PayPal")
            .Build();

        Console.WriteLine(anotherOrder);
    }
}
```

#### Output

```plaintext
Order: Laptop x1, GiftWrap: True, Shipping: Express, Payment: Credit Card, Discount: 10%
Order: Headphones x2, GiftWrap: False, Shipping: Standard, Payment: PayPal, Discount: 0%
```

### Explanation

1. **Order Class**: Contains properties to describe an order.
2. **OrderBuilder Class**: Provides methods to set each optional property. It returns the builder itself to allow chaining.
3. **Build Method**: When ready, the `Build()` method is called to return the constructed `Order` object.

### Benefits of the Builder Pattern

- **Flexible Object Construction**: You can build objects with a variety of configurations without cluttering constructors with many parameters.
- **Improved Readability**: Each part of the construction process is clearly named, making the code more readable.
- **Reusability**: You can reuse the builder to create different orders with varying configurations.

### Drawbacks

- **More Code**: This pattern requires more code compared to simple constructors.
- **Complexity**: It can add unnecessary complexity for simple objects that don't need multiple configurations.

This example illustrates how the Builder Pattern can make creating complex objects like an `Order` in an e-commerce system straightforward, readable, and flexible.
